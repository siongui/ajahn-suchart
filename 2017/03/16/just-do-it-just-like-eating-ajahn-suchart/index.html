    <div class="main-content"><p>“Just do it. Just like eating — you have to eat every day. But some days you may not feel like eating, but you know that the result of not eating is more painful than eating. It is the same with the practice. The result of not practising is more painful than practising.”</p><p> Life is short and to be lazy is to waste our time for we do not know when we are going to die, and we can only practise when we are alive. If you reflect on this, it might arouse energy. </p><p> Or think of our teacher, the Buddha, who struggled for enlightenment. We all have to struggle, for it is not easy. The Buddha had to struggle. Luangpu Chah, Luangpu Mun and everyone without exception has to struggle. So, we have to struggle too. If we think in this way, we may get energy. </p><p> The Buddha said that when you are discouraged think of your teacher. Think of the Buddha, think of all the noble disciples. How they strove and put in the effort. When you think of them you will have the energy to go forward. But if you really cannot go forward, just tell yourself that you will take a rest for a few hours and observe how things go later on, because these conditions are impermanent. But do not leave it for too long. </p><p> Sometimes listening to your teacher can help when you feel very discouraged and lose all your energy. You may get energized after listening to his talks or reading books about the life of the Buddha and some of his noble disciples. This may help you become energetic. If all else fails then just take a sabbatical, but not for too long, perhaps a day or so and see how you feel the next day. Then try to go from there. </p><p> Our practice is like going on a roller coaster. Sometimes the mind is very energetic and sometimes it’s not. Sometimes it is very easy to practise and sometimes very hard. One way to overcome this is to be consistent in your practise, to do your practise continuously regardless of whether you get results or not. Just do it. When it is time for you to sit, just sit. When it is time for you to walk, just walk. Don&#39;t do other things. </p><p> Try to be consistent with your practice. At least it will form a habit so that when the time comes for you to do certain things you will do them right away. It will be easier. The next time you have more energy your practice will go easily and quickly. Instead, if you stop completely, it can form a new habit of stopping. When you want to start again you will find it difficult to start. </p><p> So I think you have to maintain a certain level of practice. If you are used to walking or sitting for so many hours a day, keep doing it regardless of whether you like it or not. Just do it. Just like eating — you have to eat every day. But some days you may not feel like eating, but you know that the result of not eating is more painful than eating. It is the same with the practice. The result of not practising is more painful than practising. Even though sitting may be painful, it will be better than not sitting.</p><p>By <a class="reference external" href="http://phrasuchart.com/">Ajaan Suchart Abhijāto</a></p>
